Party Dress Code
Problem Statement

In this problem you take two inputs: a string SS which denotes the dress code (casual or festive) and an integer TT the temperature (in Celsius). Based on these inputs, your program should suggest an appropriate outfit for the party.

Here are the dress code guidelines:

    If the dress code is casual and the temperature is between 15°C and 25°C (inclusive), suggest "Jeans and a light jacket."

    If the dress code is festive and the temperature is above 25°C, suggest "Colorful dress and sandals."

    For all other cases, suggest "Wear what you're comfortable in."

Input

The input consists of two lines:

    The dress code (a string: "casual", or "festive").
    The temperature (an integer, 0 to 40).

Output

Print the suggested outfit based on the given inputs.
Constraints

    0 ≤≤ TT ≤≤ 40

Example 1:
Input:

casual
20

Output:

Jeans and a light jacket.

Example 2:
Input:

festive
15

Output:

Wear what you're comfortable in.

Notes:

In the example above, the program reads the dress code as "casual" and the temperature as 20°C. Since the temperature is within the range of 15°C to 25°C and the dress code is casual, the program suggests "Jeans and a light jacket."
