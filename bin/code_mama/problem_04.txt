Interoped Number Range
Problem Statement

You are given four integers: l1, r1, l2, and r2.
Your task is to print a specific range of integers following certain rules.
 Your goal is to print all the integers between l1l1 and r1r1,
 excluding the integers between l2l2 and r2r2.

However, there's a twist. The range [l2,r2][l2,r2] creates a gap within the first
range [l1,r1][l1,r1]. Your task is to identify this gap and print the two segments
of the range separately.
Input

The input consists of four integers in a single line:

    l1, r1, l2, and r2

Output

Print two segments of integers separated by a space:

    The integers between l1 and l2 (inclusive of l1, but excluding l2).
    The integers between r2 and r1 (excluding of r2, but inclusive r1).

Constraints

    0 ≤ l1 ≤ 900
    10 ≤ r1 ≤ 1000
    l1<r1
    1 ≤ l2 ≤ 901
    2 ≤ r2 ≤ 902
    l1<l2<r2<r1

Example 1:
Input:

20 40 30 35

Output:

20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 36 37 38 39 40

Example 2:
Input:

1 10 3 6

Output:

1 2 7 8 9 10

Notes:

In the example provided, the first range is [20,40][20,40], and the second range is
[30,35][30,35]. The integers between 30 and 35 (inclusive) create a gap in the first range.
The program prints two separate segments: one from 20 to 29 and the other from 36 to 40.
This honors the constraint of excluding the integers between l2l2 and r2r2.
