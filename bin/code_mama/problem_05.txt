Image container
Problem Statement

You are working on a mobile screen that includes an image. The image needs to be positioned within a container in a way that ensures the containment of various image sizes. You will be given the image's width IWIW as input. Your task is to calculate the left margin for the image within the container.

You are given the following information:

    The container's width is fixed at 1000 pixels.
    The left margin of the image should be half of the remaining space within the container.

Output the horizontal position of the image from the left side of the container.
Input

The input consists of a single line:

    An integer IW representing the width of the image.

Output

An integer representing the left margin for the image within the container.
Constraints

    400 ≤ IW ≤ 1600
    IW will always be divisible by 1010

Example 1:
put:

500

Output:

250

Example 2:
Input:

1080

Output:

0

Notes:

In the second example, for a image width of 1080 pixels which is greater than
the container(1000), so if we want to fit the image within the container it will take
full space of it.
Hence left margin will be 0.
